The diagnosis of breast tumors has traditionally been performed by a full biopsy, an invasive surgical pro- cedure. Fine needle aspirations (FNAs) provide a way to examine a small amount of tissue from the tumor; however, diagnosis with this procedure has met with mixed success." 4,5 By carefully examining both the characteristics of individual cells and important contextual features such as the size of cell clumps, physi- cians at some specialized institutions have been able to diagnose successfully using FNAs. However, many different features are thought to be correlated with malignancy, and the process remains highly subjective, depending upon the skill and experience of the physician. In order to increase the speed, correctness, and objectivity of the diagnosis process, we have used image processing and machine learning techniques.
